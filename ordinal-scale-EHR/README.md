## Abstract
Background: Although the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Progression Scale for COVID-19 is useful in prospective clinical trials, it cannot be effectively used with retrospective Electronic Health Record (EHR) datasets. We sought to develop an ordinal scale (OS) that could be used in the analyses of COVID-19 patient outcome using retrospective EHR data.

Methods: An OS was developed for purposes of assigning COVID-19 disease severity using retrospective EHR data. EHR data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) database were used to evaluate OS utility. Specifically, patients with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 1, 2020, and October 1, 2021 from 63 health organizations across the United States were examined. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was employed to characterize patterns of change in disease severity among patients during the 28-day period following a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.

Findings: The data set used in this analysis consists of 2,880,456 patients with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Principal Components Analysis of the day to day-to-day variation in ordinal scale levels over the totality of the 28-day period revealed contrasting patterns of variation in disease severity primarily within the first and second 14 days.

Interpretation: An OS with well-defined, robust features, based on discrete elements of EHR data, is useful for assessments of outcomes among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The PCA results demonstrate the usefulness of OS by providing insights into the progression of the severity of COVID-19 disease over time based on clinically relevant and robust measures. The OS provides a framework which can facilitate better understanding of the course of acute COVID-19, informing clinical decision making and resource allocation.
